# Object_Tracking_CAMSHIFT

track_modified.py - The code implements a modified version of the CAMSHIFT algorithm to track objects based on their features. The feature set in this case is extracted using color-histogram. To run the code, first the code must be run from the python shell. Once the video stream is visible, the object must be kept in front of the camera and on pressing 'i' key on the keyboard, a particular frame is captured. Using mouse keys, 4 points must be selected to form a bounding box around the object. Once that is done, press ENTER key to track the object.


face_detector.py and body_detector.py-  Both the code uses the xml Haar cascade files generated by Intel and simply implements a face detection and body detection algorithm to track faces/body in a live video stream. To use these files for commercial purposes, go through Intel's copyright agreement.
